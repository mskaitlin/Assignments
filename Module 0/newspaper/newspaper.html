    <h1>Her Beauty</h1>
        <p>rush a bit, little bit
            Roll it up, take a hit
            Feeling lit, feeling right
            Two AM, summer night, I don't care
            Hand on the wheel
            Driving drunk I'm doing my thang
            Rolling in the midwest side now
            Living my life, getting our dreams
            People told me slow my roll
            I'm screaming out fuck that
            I'm a do just what I want
            Looking ahead no turning back
            If I fall if I die
            Know I lived it to the fullest
            If I fall if I die
            Know I lived and missed some bullets</p>
    <h2>Her Grace</h2>
        <p>I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
            Everything that's shine ain't always gonna be gold (hey)
            I'll be fine once I get it, get it in, I'll be good
            I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
            Everything that's shine ain't always gonna be gold (hey)
            I'll be fine once I get it, get it in, I'll be good</p>
    <h3>Her Charm</h3>
        <p>Tell me what you know about dreamin' (dreamin')
            You ain't really know bout nothin' (nothin')
            Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
            5 A-M cold sweats, waking up to the sky
            Tell me what you know about dreams (dreams)
            Tell me what you know about night terrors nothin'
            You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow,
            Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow</p>
